# Expo 

Expo is an open-source framework and platform for building React Native applications. It provides a set of tools and services to streamline the development process, including:

- **Pre-configured Environment**: Simplifies setup with pre-built configurations.
- **Expo Go App**: Allows live preview and testing on physical devices.
- **Rich APIs**: Offers access to device features like camera, location, and notifications without native code.
- **Over-the-Air Updates**: Enables instant app updates without resubmission to app stores.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensures compatibility across iOS, Android, and web.

Expo is ideal for developers seeking a fast and efficient way to build and deploy React Native apps.

## Expo Router with TypeScript

Expo Router is a file-based routing solution for React Native applications, inspired by web frameworks like Next.js. It simplifies navigation by using the file system to define routes. When working with TypeScript, there are key concepts to consider:

### Key Concepts

1. **File-Based Routing**:
    - Routes are defined by the file structure in the `pages` directory.
    - For example, a file named `pages/home.tsx` corresponds to the `/home` route.

2. **Dynamic Routes**:
    - Use square brackets for dynamic segments, e.g., `pages/[id].tsx` for `/123`.
    - TypeScript types can be used to define the shape of route parameters.

3. **Type-Safe Navigation**:
    - Leverage TypeScript to ensure type safety when navigating between screens.
    - Use `useRouter` or `Link` components with typed route parameters.

4. **Layouts**:
    - Create reusable layouts by defining `_layout.tsx` files in directories.
    - Layouts wrap child routes and provide consistent UI structure.

5. **API Integration**:
    - Combine Expo Router with TypeScript to strongly type API responses and props passed between screens.

6. **Error Handling**:
    - Use `_error.tsx` to define a global error page for unhandled routes or exceptions.

### Example

```tsx
// pages/[id].tsx
import { useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'expo-router';

export default function DetailsScreen() {
  const { id } = useSearchParams<{ id: string }>();
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
     <View>
        <Text>Details for ID: {id}</Text>
        <Button title="Go Back" onPress={() => router.push('/')} />
     </View>
  );
}
```

By combining Expo Router with TypeScript, you can build scalable, type-safe navigation systems for your React Native applications.
